# LaPlace

## Objective
LaPlace is an open-source project that brings together lightweight and efficient AI models, built upon Llama.cpp, to run locally on mid-to-high-performance computers. The focus is on delivering speed, low resource consumption, and enhanced privacyâ€”all without requiring an internet connection.

## Key Features
- Local execution of multiple AI models
- Customizable environment for various fields (pentesting, development, automation, etc.)
- Initial support for Linux, with future expansion planned for other operating systems
- Quantized models optimized to run efficiently on standard hardware
- Specific tools for pentesting, such as port/service mapping and task automation

## Project Status
- Initial interface completed
- Translation system implemented
- Application under active development, already in testing with a functional model
- Server configured, requiring only minor final adjustments
- Backend development in progress

## How to Contribute
LaPlace is open to anyone interested in artificial intelligence, security, or development. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, your participation is welcome. Simply follow the repository, open issues, suggest improvements, or contribute code.
